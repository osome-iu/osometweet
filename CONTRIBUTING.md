### Contribution Must-Haves:
#### Pull Requests
All pull requests should (where applicable)
- [ ] Be Functional (aka, it should work without breaking anything else)
- [ ] Include a thorough docstring with a description and the following sections: Parameters, Returns, Exceptions (copy format from existing api docstrings)
- [ ] Include comments, docstrings, etc. that explain non-obvious portions of the code and increase usability of the feature/package (see [Coding Conventions](#coding-conventions) below)
- [ ] Include tests within the `tests.py` file
- [ ] Include only one feature per request
- [ ] Include a summary of the changes in the initial PR and commit messages for every commit


We also love the Wiki. 

Make sure to include helpful descriptions of how to use your new feature in a Wiki page.

#### Coding Conventions:
Take a look at the code and you'll see a very consistent format, style, and structure. This style intends to optimize the user's experience with the packge (Holy Batman! Look at those docstrings!) as well as the programmer's experience (readability and comments > one-liners and short code). Code contributions should do the same.
