##### Scripts
    * `user-lookup.py` : A command-line script for scraping many users account information. This script takes a file containing user IDs on each line as an input. You can test this script with the file [`test_data/test_user_ids.txt`](https://github.com/truthy/osometweet/blob/master/examples/test_data/test_user_ids.txt) which is a random collection of user IDs, one per row. If you'd like to use this script on a different set of user IDs the input file of new user IDs must follow the same format.
